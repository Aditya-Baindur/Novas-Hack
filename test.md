Starting with 

1.

for the vector database, you seem to be correct, but only have "last_updated" and have a empty metadata json

Cluster management is being dealt with, but scheduled serverless functions strategy works

for storage as well, yes it makes sense to have a separate table

update frequency also makes sense

API LAYER

ok restful with nextjs API routes makes sense

key endpoints I have some issues though, it should do requests like "/api/simualation?[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2]" when the user puts in the numbers
when the user puts in events it should be more like "/events?[price_reduce, 0.2]" or something, where we add that on top of the simulated numbers, but maybe having a system where we check the page embedded simulation number and add to that like that would work too, since events will go through when the numbers are put

archive logic sounds good, but we should maybe have an archive dataset to be safe and not add directly to the vector data, and add that every now and then



2.

Frontend architecture

Nextjs and typescript with shadcn ui with tailwind is good for the graphs and overall visuals

sounds good for the Key pages

State management

ok sounds good for react context api, but you were saying some stuff about nextjs API, can you elaborate

zustang is good

swr what does that mean and is it industry standard and most new

3.

Feature implementation
Real time vector processing is only necessary for new customer input, else the clusters will not be updated every time the user inputs something
Yes, but we are working on it right now, just have a mock function for now, and make it hyper type centric where we can just plug out function in and have the input and outputs super typed

Event System

sounds good for event definition

yes, indeed reversal and history tracking is super important

Visualization concepts

Shadcn ui has charts, we will use them, try to reference them for charts
no need for cluster viz for v0
decision impacts would be good, but how do you think we should showcase that?
historical trends 100% we need that on the dashboard page

4.
Dataflow
yes variables with sliders, all from shadcn
yes, frontend will send to simulation, which will check the cluster that the vector belongs to
yes, it matches
yes the result is returned, what viz data will we show
yes, user can apply events as you perfectly described, I will have a table for this too where we will know that the event will do to the data (ex: 30% decrease in price sensitivity)
yes, vector modified
yes, but in an archive database not the vector database directly

5.
Deployment
Vercel, correct, but I should be able to run it locally too for now
supabase yes, so I need the table schemas and so on
CI/CD can we do better because you were mentioning the serverless scheduled functions for cluster generation and so on, please elaborate
Env separation, not necessarily needed but why not, makes things simpler but you have to tell me how I do this in vercel and supabase exactly, like do we need a dev table and production table
feature flags for gradual rollout, why not, tell me how

6.
We're working on the mathematical model, for now make a hyperly type dependant function that we can replace, knn maybe
Elaborate on security auth, we will be putting this in out platform
Let's say 10 people using at the same time, maybe microservices might be needed but lets keep that to v1, but lay the groundwork kinda, or at east mention it in some way
for infrastructure configure reliability, what exactly do you mean, can you elaborate
For now only if it will be bough or not, like we input the 4 numbers, maybe we put in the events, we get "BOUGHT" or "NOT BOUGHT", but elaborate further on this subject

7.
dev roadmap
Ok yeah that should be good
